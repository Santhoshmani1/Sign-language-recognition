# Sign Language Recognition with LSTM Neural Network

## Introduction

Sign language is a comprehensive language system that employs hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements to communicate. It serves as a primary means of communication for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.

In this project, we aim to bridge the communication gap by developing a system that can recognize and interpret sign language. We leverage the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction problems.
